# The Analysis

## 1. What are the most popular demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?

To find the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles. I filtered out those positions by which ones were the most popular, and got the top 5 skills for these top 3 roles. This query highlights the most popular job titles and their top skills, showing which skills I should pay attention to depending on the role I'm targeting.

### Visualize Data

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles), 1)


for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
    df_plot = df_skills_perc[df_skills_perc['job_title_short'] == job_title].head(5)[::-1]
    sns.barplot(data=df_plot, x='skill_percent', y='job_skills', ax=ax[i], hue='skill_count', palette='dark:b_r')

plt.show()
```

### Results

### Insights 

- Python is a versatile skill, highly demanded across all three roles, but most prominently for Data Scientists (72%) and Data Engineers (65%).
- SQL is the most requested skill for Data Analysts and Data Scientists, with it in over half the job postings for both roles. For Data Engineers, Python is the most sought-after skill, appearing in 68% of job postings.
- Data Engineers require more specialized Data Analysts and Data Scientists who are expected to be proficient in more general data management and analysis tools (Excel, Tableau).

## 2. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?

### Visualize Data

```python

from matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter

df_plot = df_DA_US_percent.iloc[:, :5]
sns.lineplot(data=df_plot, dashes=False, legend='full', palette='tab10')

plt.gca().yaxis.set_major_formatter(PercentFormatter(decimals=0))

pl.show()

```
 
### Results

*Bar graph visualizing the trending top skills for data analysts in the US in 2023.*

### Insights:
- SQL remains the most consistently demanded skill throughout the year, although it shows a gradual decrease in demand.
- Excel experienced a significant increase in demand starting around September, surpassing both Python and Tableau by the end of the year.
- Both Python and Tableau show relatively stable demand throughout the year with some fluctuations but remain essential skills for data analysts. Power BI, while less demanded compared to the others, shows a slight upward trend towards the year's end.

## 3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?

To identify the highest-paying roles and skills, I only got jobs in the United States and looked at their median salary. But first I looked at the salary distributions of common data jobs like Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Data Analyst, to get an idea of which jobs are paid the most.

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [4_Salary_Analysis](3_Project/4_Salary_Analysis.ipynb)
```python
sns.boxplot(data=df_US_top6, x='salary_year_avg', y='job_title_short', order=job_order)

ticks_x = plt.FuncFormatter(lambda y, pos: f'${int(y/1000)}K')
plt.gca().xaxis.set_major_formatter(ticks_x)
plt.show()
```

### Results

*Box plot visualizing the salary distributions for the top 6 data job titles.*


### Insights
- There's a significant variation in salary ranges across different job titles. Senior Data Scientist positions tend to have the highest salary potential, with up to $600K, indicating the high value placed on advanced data skills and experience in the industry.

- Senior Data Engineer and Senior Data Scientist roles show a considerable number of outliers on the higher end of the salary spectrum, suggesting that exceptional skills or circumstances can lead to high pay in these roles. In contrast, Data Analyst roles demonstrate more consistency in salary, with fewer outliers.

- The median salaries increase with the seniority and specialization of the roles. Senior roles (Senior Data Scientist, Senior Data Engineer) not only have higher median salaries but also larger differences in typical salaries, reflecting greater variance in compensation as responsibilities increase.





### Highest Paid & Most Demanded Skills for Data Analysts
Next, I narrowed my analysis and focused only on data analyst roles. I looked at the highest-paid skills and the most in-demand skills. I used two bar charts to showcase these.

Visualize Data
```python

fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 1)  

# Top 10 Highest Paid Skills for Data Analysts
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_top_pay, x='median', y=df_DA_top_pay.index, hue='median', ax=ax[0], palette='dark:b_r')

# Top 10 Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analystsr')
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_skills, x='median', y=df_DA_skills.index, hue='median', ax=ax[1], palette='light:b')

plt.show()
```

### Results
Here's the breakdown of the highest-paid & most in-demand skills for data analysts in the US:
![The Highest Paid & Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts in The US](3_Project/Images/Highest_Paid_and_Most_In_Demand_Skills_for_Data_Analysts_in_US.png)
*Two separate bar graphs visualizing the highest paid skills and most in-demand skills for data analysts in the US.*

### Insights:
- The top graph shows specialized technical skills like `dplyr`, `Bitbucket`, and `Gitlab` are associated with higher salaries, some reaching up to $200K, suggesting that advanced technical proficiency can increase earning potential.

- The bottom graph highlights that foundational skills like `Excel`, `PowerPoint`, and `SQL` are the most in-demand, even though they may not offer the highest salaries. This demonstrates the importance of these core skills for employability in data analysis roles.

- There's a clear distinction between the skills that are highest paid and those that are most in-demand. Data analysts aiming to maximize their career potential should consider developing a diverse skill set that includes both high-paying specialized skills and widely demanded foundational skills.




## 4. What are the most optimal skills to learn for Data Analysts?
To identify the most optimal skills to learn ( the ones that are the highest paid and highest in demand) I calculated the percent of skill demand and the median salary of these skills. To easily identify which are the most optimal skills to learn.

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [5_optimal_Skills](3_Project/5_Optimal_Skills.ipynb)

### Visualize Data
```python
from adjustText import adjust_text
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.scatter(df_DA_skills_high_demand['skill_percent'], df_DA_skills_high_demand['median_salary'])
plt.show()
```
### Results

![Most Optimal Skills for Data Analysts in the US](3_Project/Images/Most_Optimal_Skills_for_Data_Analysts_in_the_US.png)
*A scatter plot visualizing the most optimal skills (high paying & high demand) for data analysts in the US.*

## Insights:
- The skill Oracle appears to have the highest median salary of nearly $97K, despite being less common in job postings. This suggests a high value placed on specialized database skills within the data analyst profession.

- More commonly required skills like Excel and SQL have a large presence in job listings but lower median salaries compared to specialized skills like Python and Tableau, which not only have higher salaries but are also moderately prevalent in job listings.

- Skills such as Python, Tableau, and SQL Server are towards the higher end of the salary spectrum while also being fairly common in job listings, indicating that proficiency in these tools can lead to good opportunities in data analytics.

## Visualizing Different Techonologies
Let's visualize the different technologies as well in the graph. We'll add color labels based on the technology (e.g., {Programming: Python})
## Visualize Data
```python
from matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter

# Create a scatter plot
scatter = sns.scatterplot(
    data=df_DA_skills_tech_high_demand,
    x='skill_percent',
    y='median_salary',
    hue='technology',  # Color by technology
    palette='bright',  # Use a bright palette for distinct colors
    legend='full'  # Ensure the legend is shown
)
plt.show()
```
## Results

*A scatter plot visualizing the most optimal skills (high paying & high demand) for data analysts in the US with color labels for technology.*
### Insights:
- The scatter plot shows that most of the programming skills (colored blue) tend to cluster at higher salary levels compared to other categories, indicating that programming expertise might offer greater salary benefits within the data analytics field.

- The database skills (colored orange), such as Oracle and SQL Server, are associated with some of the highest salaries among data analyst tools. This indicates a significant demand and valuation for data management and manipulation expertise in the industry.

- Analyst tools (colored green), including Tableau and Power BI, are prevalent in job postings and offer competitive salaries, showing that visualization and data analysis software are crucial for current data roles. This category not only has good salaries but is also versatile across different types of data tasks.
